# Technical Notes

## About

A collection of personal technical notes, config examples, and quick-reference guides.

These notes support my learning around Docker, Git, Bash, and related tools.

Work in progress and intentionally minimal — practical examples only.

##  Structure

- **[`cheatsheets/`](cheatsheets/)**  
  Quick-reference notes for tools and commands.  

- **[`config-examples/`](config-examples/)**  
  Reusable configuration snippets.  

- **[`guides/`](guides/)**  
  Short, step-by-step setup guides and walkthroughs.

(Structure may change as I progress)
